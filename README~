Creating a reliable TCP client

For this project we decided to incorporate many of the common aspects we 
learned about in class.  These included Sliding Window Protocol, Congestion
Control, Checksum, and TCP Reno.  

We started by getting the basic windowing to work for a safe network.  Once 
this was working we worked on getting the receiver to neglect repeat packets
and be able to put messages back together in order if they were received out
of order.  After this was working we tested on an unrelaible network.  
Checksum was also added to help deal with packet corruption.

Next we began implementing TCP Reno to improve run-time performance.  We 
decided to use 5 repeat ACKs instead of 3, because it seemed to perform
better.  If this number is larger we will have better memory performance,
because we may not retransmit packets that the receiver might actually
have, but were more than 3 spaces out of order.

The next part of this project was implementing congestion control to help
with performance.  We played around with this and other intracies of our
implementation for a while trying to improve performance.

Challenges
******************************************************************************
One of the main challenges with the project, contrary to the others, was 
the performance tests.  With this project we di not have a baseline to pass
for both memory and run-time performance.  This meant we were constantly 
rethinking and questioning our approach in order to optimize one or the other.
We also had to make decisions dependent on whether memory perf or run-time
perf was more important, because their are times when they conflict 
(fast retransmit, etc.).  

Other Challenges involved implementing slow start and overall congestion
window protocols.
